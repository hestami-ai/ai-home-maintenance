# Edge Runtime Authentication Solution

This document explains the solution implemented to address Edge Runtime compatibility issues with Redis in Next.js 14.

## Problem

In Next.js 14, middleware can only run in the Edge Runtime, which has limited API support compared to the Node.js runtime. The Redis client we were using is not compatible with Edge Runtime, causing errors when the middleware tried to access Redis.

## Solution

We've implemented a memory-based cache that works in Edge Runtime while maintaining the same API as our previous Redis implementation. This allows our authentication system to work seamlessly in both environments.

### Key Components

1. **Memory Cache Implementation**
   - Created a `cache.ts` module that provides an in-memory cache with Redis-like API
   - Implemented key expiration with TTL support
   - Used a singleton pattern to ensure a single cache instance across the application

2. **TokenService Adaptation**
   - Updated the TokenService to use our cache implementation
   - Maintained the same functionality for storing, retrieving, and managing tokens

3. **Middleware Configuration**
   - Simplified the middleware configuration to work with Edge Runtime
   - Used the Auth.js middleware with proper route matching

4. **API Routes**
   - Updated all authentication-related API routes to work with our cache
   - Improved error handling and logging

## Benefits

1. **Edge Runtime Compatibility**
   - The application now works correctly in Edge Runtime
   - No more errors related to Redis compatibility

2. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Removed the need for runtime configuration
   - Eliminated the dependency on external Redis service for Edge Runtime

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - The application continues to work even if Redis is unavailable
   - Maintains security with proper token management

## Limitations

1. **Memory-Based Storage**
   - In-memory cache is not persistent across server restarts
   - Cache is not shared across multiple instances of the application

2. **No Distributed Cache**
   - Cannot share cache data across multiple servers or instances
   - May require additional solutions for horizontal scaling

## Future Improvements

1. **Persistent Storage**
   - Consider implementing a persistent storage solution for the cache
   - Explore Edge-compatible database options

2. **Distributed Cache**
   - Investigate options for distributed caching that work in Edge Runtime
   - Consider using a service like Upstash Redis if it becomes necessary

3. **Session Management**
   - Enhance session management to be more resilient to cache limitations
   - Implement additional security measures for token validation
