## Architecture Decisions

### Storage Strategy: Hybrid Local + Backend

**Local Storage (Primary)**
- Location: `~/Documents/RoomScans/`
- Format: USDZ files + JSON metadata
- Benefits: Offline access, fast retrieval, no CoreData complexity

**Backend Storage (Secondary)**
- Endpoint: `/api/properties/{id}/media/upload/`
- Type: FLOORPLAN media subtype
- Benefits: Cloud backup, cross-device sync, property association

### Why This Approach?

1. **No CoreData Required** - Avoided complexity of setting up CoreData stack
2. **Leverages Existing Backend** - Uses established Media API infrastructure
3. **Offline-First** - Works without network, syncs when available
4. **Follows App Patterns** - Consistent with existing architecture
5. **Simple & Maintainable** - FileManager + JSON is straightforward

## Key Features

### User Features
- ✅ Scan and save rooms in 3D
- ✅ Name scans with auto-generated defaults
- ✅ Associate scans with properties
- ✅ View scans in native 3D viewer (QuickLook)
- ✅ Upload scans to cloud for backup
- ✅ Manage saved scans (view, upload, delete)
- ✅ Track upload status (Local, Uploading, Cloud, Failed)
- ✅ Monitor storage usage
- ✅ Export scans as USDZ files

### Developer Features
- ✅ Clean service layer architecture
- ✅ Async/await for all I/O operations
- ✅ Proper error handling with user feedback
- ✅ Haptic feedback for actions
- ✅ Type-safe models with Codable
- ✅ Reusable components
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

```

## Integration Points

### Backend API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/properties/{property_id}/media/upload/`
- **Authentication**: Session cookie (existing)
- **Media Type**: `FILE` with subtype `FLOORPLAN`
- **Location Type**: `INTERIOR`

### Existing Services Used
- `NetworkManager` - HTTP requests and cookie management
- `HapticManager` - User feedback
- `PropertiesViewModel` - Property data for selection

## User Flow

```
1. User taps "Start Scanning" in RoomPlanView
2. Performs room scan with device camera
3. Taps "Stop Scanning" when complete
4. Scan captured, shows completion UI
5. User taps "Save Scan"
6. Enters name and optionally selects property
7. Scan saved locally to Documents/RoomScans/
8. User can tap "Upload to Cloud"
9. Selects property (required for backend)
10. Scan uploaded to backend Media API
11. Status updates to "Cloud" (uploaded)
12. User can view saved scans via folder icon
13. Can view, upload, or delete any scan
```

## Technical Highlights

### Local Storage
- Files stored in app's Documents directory
- Metadata in JSON format for easy debugging
- Atomic file operations
- Automatic directory creation
- File size tracking

### Backend Upload
- Multipart form data encoding
- Progress tracking via upload status
- Retry capability for failed uploads
- Backend media ID stored for reference
- Proper MIME type handling (`model/vnd.usdz+zip`)

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Haptic feedback for success/failure
- Graceful degradation (offline mode)
- Detailed logging for debugging

### UI/UX
- Native iOS design patterns
- Consistent with app theme
- Loading states for async operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Status badges for upload state
- QuickLook integration for 3D preview

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Save scan without property
- [ ] Save scan with property
- [ ] Upload scan to backend
- [ ] View scan in QuickLook
- [ ] Delete scan
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Test with multiple scans
- [ ] Verify storage calculation
- [ ] Test upload retry after failure
- [ ] Test with different room sizes

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No internet connection
- [ ] Backend API errors
- [ ] Insufficient storage space
- [ ] Invalid property ID
- [ ] Corrupted USDZ file
- [ ] App termination during save/upload

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Auto-upload** - Upload automatically when on WiFi
2. **Compression** - Reduce file sizes
3. **Better Thumbnails** - Generate 3D preview images
4. **Sharing** - Share via AirDrop/Messages
5. **Annotations** - Add notes to scans
6. **Room Detection** - Auto-detect room type
7. **Batch Operations** - Multi-select for bulk actions
8. **Search/Filter** - Find scans by criteria
9. **Export Formats** - Support OBJ, FBX, etc.
10. **AR Preview** - Preview in AR before saving

### Technical Improvements
1. **Background Upload** - Upload in background
2. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle sync conflicts
3. **Incremental Sync** - Only sync changes
4. **Cache Management** - Automatic cleanup
5. **Analytics** - Track usage patterns

## Dependencies

### iOS Frameworks
- `RoomPlan` - 3D room scanning (iOS 16+)
- `QuickLook` - USDZ file preview
- `Foundation` - File management
- `SwiftUI` - UI components
- `AVFoundation` - Camera permissions

### App Services
- `NetworkManager` - HTTP client
- `HapticManager` - Haptic feedback
- `PropertiesViewModel` - Property data

### No Third-Party Dependencies
- Pure Swift implementation
- Uses only Apple frameworks
- No external libraries required

## Performance Considerations

### File Sizes
- USDZ files: typically 1-5 MB per scan
- Thumbnails: ~50-100 KB per scan
- Metadata: negligible (~1 KB total)

### Storage Impact
- 100 scans ≈ 100-500 MB
- Reasonable for most users
- Storage size displayed in UI

### Network Impact
- Upload only on user action
- No automatic background sync
- WiFi recommended for uploads

## Security Considerations

### Local Storage
- Files in app's sandboxed Documents directory
- Not accessible by other apps
- Backed up to iCloud (if user enabled)
- Cleared on app deletion

### Backend Upload
- Uses existing session authentication
- HTTPS only
- Property ownership verified by backend
- No sensitive data in USDZ files

## Compliance

### Privacy
- Camera permission required and requested
- User controls all uploads
- No automatic data collection
- Files stored locally by default

### Data Retention
- User controls deletion
- Backend follows existing media retention policies
- Local files persist until deleted

## Known Limitations

1. **iOS 16+ Required** - RoomPlan framework requirement
2. **LiDAR Devices Only** - iPhone 12 Pro and later, iPad Pro
3. **No Background Scanning** - Must be in foreground
4. **Single Room Per Scan** - Cannot merge multiple scans
5. **No Editing** - Cannot modify saved scans
6. **Manual Upload** - No automatic sync

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly solution for RoomPlan scan storage that:
- ✅ Works offline with local storage
- ✅ Syncs to cloud when needed
- ✅ Integrates with existing backend
- ✅ Follows app architecture patterns
- ✅ Requires no CoreData setup
- ✅ Provides excellent UX
- ✅ Is maintainable and extensible

The hybrid local + backend approach gives users the best of both worlds: fast offline access with cloud backup and cross-device sync capabilities.
