# Hestami Staff & Audit UX — Consolidated Implementation Roadmap

**Document Type:** Implementation Roadmap with Progress Tracking  
**Scope:** Staff UX (Phase 16) + Audit Review & Forensics UX (Phase 14)  
**Status:** Sub-Phases 1-11 Complete — Full Implementation Done

---

## Overview

This roadmap consolidates the **Staff UX** and **Audit Review & Forensics UX** into a single implementation plan. The Staff UX is the internal operating system for Hestami personnel, while Audit Review provides the accountability and forensics layer that makes all operations defensible.

### Key Dependencies
- **Phase 13 Concierge Case UX**: ✅ Completed (provides Case model foundation)
- **ActivityEvent Infrastructure**: ✅ Exists (`activityEvent.ts` middleware)
- **Cerbos Authorization**: ✅ Exists (policy-based access control)
- **oRPC + Zod Pipeline**: ✅ Exists (type-safe API layer)

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Staff Management & Lifecycle** first (foundational for all staff operations)
2. **Work Queue** second (daily operational surface)
3. **Case Detail UX** third (leverages existing Case model)
4. **Audit Review UX** fourth (consumes ActivityEvent data)
5. **Vendor Management UX** fifth (extends existing vendor infrastructure)
6. **Communications UX** sixth (cross-cutting concern)

- Cross-pillar context (CAM, Contractor, Concierge)
- OpenTelemetry trace correlation
- Typed metadata schemas

All new features must integrate with this infrastructure for audit compliance.

### Cerbos Authorization
New resources requiring Cerbos policies:
- `staff` — Staff entity CRUD and lifecycle
- `audit` — Read-only audit access
- `workQueue` — Work queue access by role
- `vendorCandidate` — Vendor research and capture

### Type Generation Pipeline
After each API implementation:
1. `npm run openapi:generate`
2. `npm run types:generate`
3. Update `cam.ts` with new type exports
4. `npm run check` to verify
