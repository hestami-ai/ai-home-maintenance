A high-fidelity landing page  for a property technology platform. Three distinct vertical sections:

Top Section: A wide 'Concierge' feature card with a real-life photo of a modern home interior on the right. A floating smartphone UI on the left showing a 'Virtual Estimating' screen with a photo of a plumbing leak. Text: 'Virtual Estimating' with a small 'Homeowner' tag.

Middle Section: A clean horizontal process flow on a white background. Three circular icons connected by teal lines representing 'Homeowner Submits', 'HOA Approves', and 'Contractor Bids'. Text below reads 'Autonomous Workflow, Zero Friction'.

Bottom Section: A high-impact CTA 'Ready to bridge the gap?' over a deep navy and teal gradient background. A large rounded Solar Amber button centered with the text 'Experience the Integrated Ecosystem'. Overall style: Professional SaaS aesthetic, Inter font, 24px rounded corners, clean white space, and a mix of high-end lifestyle photography and minimalist UI elements.
