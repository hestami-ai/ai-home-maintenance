ser Experience Comparison
Element Scan (Door/Window/Frame measurement)
During Capture:

User stands 1-2m from element
Walks slow semicircle around target
HUD shows:
Wall Plane Locked indicator
Opening Likely status
Boundary Coverage % (left jamb, right jamb, header, sill)
Readiness Score (target ≥0.75)
Local point cloud/mesh around frame
Rectangle overlay confirming detected opening
Stop Condition: Opening detected + boundaries ≥90% covered + readiness ≥0.75

Session Contents:

3 ProRAW reference photos (left/center/right angles)
ARKit keyframes with RGB + depth + confidence
Voxel map (2m range, 5cm voxels)
Wall plane + opening boundary data
Room Scan (Full room capture)
During Capture:

User starts in corner, sweeps walls
Captures each corner (critical)
Periodically includes floor/ceiling intersections
HUD shows:
Coverage Score % (target ≥65%)
Observability Score % (view angle diversity)
Walls Detected count (target ≥3-4)
Corners Detected count (target ≥2)
Floor Found indicator
Coverage heatmap (green=good, yellow=marginal, red=missing)
Voxel visualization spheres
Stop Condition: Floor found + ≥3 walls + ≥2 corners + coverage ≥65% + readiness ≥0.70

Session Contents:
