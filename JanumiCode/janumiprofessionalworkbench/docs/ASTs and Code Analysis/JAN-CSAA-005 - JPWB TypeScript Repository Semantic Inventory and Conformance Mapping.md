# JPWB TypeScript Repository Semantic Inventory and Conformance Mapping

## Revision-bound repository facts, configured assurance surfaces, conformance mappings, uncertainty, and open observations

**Document ID:** `JAN-CSAA-005`

**Canonical title:** JPWB TypeScript Repository Semantic Inventory and Conformance Mapping

**Version:** `0.1.0`

**Status:** Draft

**Settledness:** HYPOTHESIS

**Classification:** Prepared controlled-CSAA member candidate; non-authoritative Draft; live manifest-synchronization state is controlled by `JAN-CSAA-W1-GAP-001` and any later exact recorded disposition; this Draft does not self-declare closure

**Governing status:** Draft authoring and adversarial review are commissioned by `JPWB-REG-005 REG-D-018`; this document has no member authority

**Role:** Descriptive, revision-bound inventory of the recorded JPWB TypeScript repository subject and mapping of observed implementation, configuration, tests, evidence instruments, and gaps to their concern-owning obligations

**Authority:** None. `REG-D-018` authorizes preparation and review of this Draft; only a later exact-version/digest sponsor conferral can make a revision Normative

**Scope:** Recorded-snapshot workspaces, packages, apps, project contexts, dependency declarations, source classifications, generated contracts, configured commands, architecture rules, tests, coverage, mutation, runtime seams, observability, and missing semantic capabilities within the first JPWB subject

**Applicability:** The repository state rooted at `E:/Projects/hestami-ai/JanumiCode/janumiprofessionalworkbench`, bound to parent commit `e673fb5c2e186fb0873d3720036e5e8d7b00038a`, the explicit implementation/configuration manifest below, and the separately identified generated SvelteKit configuration

**Observation time:** `2026-07-26T11:52:31.6050250-04:00`

**As-of state:** `STALE_FOR_CURRENT_REPOSITORY`; `CURRENT_FOR_RECORDED_SNAPSHOT_ONLY` at the recorded observation. The repository observations are not a claim about any later worktree or commit

**Freshness recheck:** At `2026-07-26T12:26:43.0845620-04:00`, repository `HEAD` was `3492a3da0188c996019965073fd94abdb3b123cf`; comparison with the recorded parent showed implementation/configuration changes and a different `packages` tree. This Draft was not refreshed to that later subject

**Evidence provenance:** [JAN-CSAA-005 Preparation Evidence Snapshot](<records/JAN-CSAA-005 - Preparation Evidence Snapshot.md>), including the exact Git subject, tracked-manifest, configuration, method, and no-execution records; [JAN-CSAA-005 Refresh Blocker Record](<records/JAN-CSAA-005 - Refresh Blocker Record.md>), preserving the later failed stable-subject prerequisite without carrying any later fact into this inventory

**Last verification time:** None. Preparation evidence was observed at the time above, but no independent verification, build, test, analyzer, generator, mutation, gate, or runtime-trace execution has been performed for this Draft

**Staleness and supersession condition:** The conclusion-affecting triggers in §3.4 make affected observations stale. `CSAA-005-REQ-059` and `CSAA-005-REQ-313` preserve this revision and its observations as historical evidence when a successor is authored

**Governs:** While Draft, nothing with program authority. Candidate concern allocation: the method and result of describing recorded-snapshot JPWB repository facts, their revision/worktree provenance, their conformance mappings, their uncertainty, and their staleness

**Does not govern:** Canonical Janumi meaning; TypeScript semantic-object meaning; extraction, inference, query, or change-impact algorithms; Analysis Rule Profiles; Analyzer Finding Records; severity, suppression, waiver, or repository-gate semantics; exact machine schemas or APIs; fixture or oracle judgments; provider qualification; physical persistence; coding-agent procedure; installation; execution; topology; implementation permission; source mutation; remediation

**Parent and inherited authorities:** `JAN-CSAA-000@0.3.0`, `JPWB-CON-000`, `JPWB-DOC-001`, `JPWB-DOC-002`, `JPWB-DOC-003`, `JPWB-DOC-004`, and applicable `JPWB-REG-005` entries, each only for its owned concern

**Precedence and conflict routing:** Canon and recognized enforced reference artifacts retain concern ownership. `JAN-CSAA-001` owns candidate logical architecture; `JAN-CSAA-002` owns candidate provider-independent code-semantic identity; later `JAN-CSAA-003` and `JAN-CSAA-004` are reserved to own analysis/query and rule/finding/gate semantics. This document reports repository facts and divergence without silently adjudicating authority. `CSAA-005-REQ-008` records apparent conflicts, and `CSAA-005-REQ-103` routes them to their concern owner through `JPWB-REG-005`

**Requirement ledger:** [JAN-CSAA-005 Requirement Ledger](<records/JAN-CSAA-005 - Requirement Ledger.md>)

**Verification owner:** The author owns extraction and self-review evidence. An independent reviewer owns Proposed-candidate adversarial review. Neither can confer Normative status

**Change authority and procedure:** Authors MAY revise this Draft under `REG-D-018`. The transition controls in inherited `CSAA-000-REQ-165` through `CSAA-000-REQ-168` govern ledger closure, self-review, independent review, and exact-candidate sponsor conferral. A material change to Proposed bytes reopens the affected review

**Preparation evidence:** [JAN-CSAA-005 Preparation Evidence Snapshot](<records/JAN-CSAA-005 - Preparation Evidence Snapshot.md>)

**Review and evidence companions:** Preparation evidence and requirement ledger above; [JAN-CSAA-005 Refresh Blocker Record](<records/JAN-CSAA-005 - Refresh Blocker Record.md>); [Wave 1 Manifest Gap Record](<records/JAN-CSAA-W1 - Draft Authoring Initiation and Manifest Gap Record.md>); self-review and formal independent-review records are not yet authored

**Companion enforced artifacts:** None created or selected by this Draft. Existing source, manifests, generated contracts, configurations, tests, and scripts remain revision-bound repository evidence and retain only their existing concern-specific standing

**Conformance-test references:** Later `JAN-CSAA-006` through `JAN-CSAA-008`; reserved and uncommissioned

**Audience:** Coding-agent designers, TypeScript engineers, software architects, assurance engineers, security reviewers, tool integrators, implementers, and maintainers

**Background:** [JAN-CSAA-000](<README.md>); [JAN-CSAA-001](<JAN-CSAA-001 - Codebase Semantic Analysis and Assurance Architecture.md>); [JAN-CSAA-002](<JAN-CSAA-002 - TypeScript Semantic Model and Invariant Catalog.md>); [Initial Chat](<Initial Chat.md>)

**Structural exemplar:** [Recursive Professional Harness document-set README](<../Recursive Professional Harness/README.md>)

**Supersedes:** None

**Superseded by:** None

**Normative keywords:** SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY. Their meanings and the non-normative treatment of examples are inherited from `JAN-CSAA-000@0.3.0` §5

## 1. Purpose

This Draft answers a deliberately narrow question:

> What TypeScript repository subject existed at the recorded JPWB snapshot, which configured instruments could observe or verify it, what did those instruments actually cover, and which conclusions remained unsupported?

It is a parallel evidence feed. It does not make the implementation normative, infer architectural authority from repository presence, or select the recorded-snapshot toolchain as the future CSAA implementation.

The implementation is the source of truth for current implementation facts. Canon, controlled specifications, registered decisions, and enforced reference artifacts remain the sources of truth for their own obligations. A difference between those sources is an observation requiring concern-owner treatment, not permission for this inventory to choose a winner.

---

## 2. Authority and interpretation boundary

### 2.1 Descriptive ownership

`JAN-CSAA-005` owns recorded-snapshot description only. It may state that a package, import, command, threshold, generated artifact, runtime seam, or gap was observed in a precisely identified subject. It may not:

- declare an observed dependency desirable;
- convert a roadmap statement into enforced architecture;
- call an open observation an Analyzer Finding Record;
- assign authoritative severity;
- create an accepted exception, suppression, waiver, or gate result;
- approve a provider, dependency, deployment topology, or storage technology;
- authorize installation, execution, generation, mutation, source change, or remediation; or
- represent configured but unexecuted tooling as healthy or passing.

### 2.2 Evidence versus authority

The following distinctions are load-bearing:

```text
Observed source or configuration       != approved architecture
Configured command                     != executed command
Existing derived output                != fresh evidence
Lexically observed import              != compiler-resolved semantic edge
Missing named configuration            != universal impossibility
Open observation                       != Analyzer Finding Record
Roadmap divergence                     != adjudicated violation
Repository test                        != CSAA conformance suite
Recorded-snapshot tool                 != qualified CSAA provider
```

## 3. Observation identity and subject binding

### 3.1 Exact recorded snapshot

| Field | Recorded value |
| --- | --- |
| Observation time | `2026-07-26T11:52:31.6050250-04:00` |
| Repository root | `E:/Projects/hestami-ai` |
| JPWB subject root | `E:/Projects/hestami-ai/JanumiCode/janumiprofessionalworkbench` |
| Branch / parent commit | `main` / `e673fb5c2e186fb0873d3720036e5e8d7b00038a` |
| JPWB porcelain-v2 status | 57 records: 15 tracked changes and 42 untracked paths; all observed records were under `docs/**` |
| JPWB status-manifest SHA-256 | `95178408efa287ddfdd2a29e42be20e75ba0a61a946e0141a47eee73f2102054` |
| Implementation/configuration status | Zero porcelain-v2 records, including untracked paths, for the explicit scope in §3.2 |
| Tracked implementation/configuration manifest | 528 `git ls-files -s` records; SHA-256 `43961152982d7082c5f2f5644d84e1b2b4282d834b42319ca44a8d620333d4ea` |
| `packages` Git tree object | `fc84e78a63513fe7c97fc7516cd265b590277f4b` |
| `apps` Git tree object | `082b937ce653ad9ecd72b239ffb72aac1a7aa49d` |

The status-manifest digest hashes UTF-8, LF-terminated, ordinal-sorted porcelain-v2 records with one terminal LF. It is worktree-status identity, not a digest of every file.

The tracked subject digest hashes UTF-8, LF-terminated, ordinal-sorted `git ls-files -s` records with one terminal LF. Those records bind paths to Git modes, blob identities, and stages. Because the explicit implementation/configuration scope had no worktree record, its tracked content equals the recorded parent commit.

### 3.2 Explicit tracked implementation/configuration scope

The 528-record manifest includes:

- root `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `bunfig.toml`, `turbo.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `vitest.config.ts`;
- root ESLint, Prettier, dependency-cruiser, Sonar, and Git-ignore configuration;
- `.github/**`;
- `packages/**`;
- `apps/**`;
- `scripts/**`; and
- `verif/**`.

This identity includes inventory-only and excluded artifact classes so their existence can be classified. It does not expand compiler-confirmed semantic support.

### 3.3 Generated SvelteKit configuration

`apps/rph-demo/.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` is ignored and therefore not represented by the parent commit or tracked manifest.

| Field | Recorded value |
| --- | --- |
| Path | `apps/rph-demo/.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` |
| Bytes | 1,010 |
| SHA-256 | `c01d35eee60b3cb21e230c392c72c947234d7f406b83959a042a63e09db454c4` |
| Last-write time, UTC | `2026-07-26T13:24:25.1297328Z` |
| Freshness conclusion | Not established |

The file is configuration evidence for the app include surface. It is not compiler-confirmed freshness evidence because `svelte-kit sync` is write-producing and was not authorized or run by this preparation stream.

### 3.4 Staleness rule

This inventory is `CURRENT_FOR_RECORDED_SNAPSHOT_ONLY`. It becomes stale for affected conclusions when any of the following changes:

- parent commit;
- a tracked implementation/configuration path;
- the explicit tracked manifest membership or digest;
- the generated SvelteKit configuration bytes;
- a workspace manifest, export map, lockfile, project context, build/test command, architecture rule, generated source, schema input, runtime entry point, trace source, or evidence instrument;
- a previously excluded region becomes supported; or
- an observation is adjudicated by its concern owner.

Under `CSAA-005-REQ-058` and `CSAA-005-REQ-296` through `CSAA-005-REQ-300`, promotion review re-observes the subject rather than inferring freshness from this Draft's modification time.

At the read-only freshness recheck recorded in the metadata, `HEAD` had advanced from `e673fb5c2e186fb0873d3720036e5e8d7b00038a` to `3492a3da0188c996019965073fd94abdb3b123cf`. Eleven selected implementation/configuration paths differed, including `rph-application`, generated and source contract artifacts, `rph-domain`, and the mutation ledger; the `packages` tree changed from `fc84e78a63513fe7c97fc7516cd265b590277f4b` to `a3cd8d959c732caece5a82f34236ab208f28cfb9`. Therefore this inventory is explicitly stale for the current repository and remains only a record of the earlier exact subject. No fact was carried forward to the later commit.

The later [Refresh Blocker Record](<records/JAN-CSAA-005 - Refresh Blocker Record.md>) shows that two complete read-only observations did not produce an identical dirty subject. It is evidence of why refresh did not proceed, not a refreshed inventory or a source of carried-forward implementation facts.

## 4. Subject and artifact classification

### 4.1 Supported static subject

The supported first static subject is:

- the ten `packages/rph-*` source projects under their declared normal and build TypeScript contexts;
- the shared compiler configuration under `packages/typescript-config`;
- app TypeScript, JavaScript, and Svelte source included by the recorded generated SvelteKit context, with the freshness qualification in §3.3;
- included package and app unit tests as test-classified artifacts;
- generator source and generated TypeScript as different artifact classes;
- manifests, exports, lockfile identities, and existing architecture rules as contextual graph inputs.

### 4.2 Inventory-only perimeter

The following are inventoried but not claimed compiler-complete:

- root `vitest.config.ts`;
- `scripts/mutants/**`;
- `verif/**`;
- Playwright configurations, deterministic E2E files, setup, and teardown;
- live/network E2E files;
- `apps/rph-demo/static/theme-init.js`;
- generated `.svelte-kit` content other than the consumed configuration context; and
- other executable seams outside a declared TypeScript project.

### 4.3 Excluded first-subject regions

The first semantic subject excludes:

- `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.turbo`, coverage output, Playwright output, caches, and temporary databases;
- TypeScript projects and prototypes under `docs/**`;
- `apps/rph-demo/harness/**`;
- third-party source beyond identity, manifest, lockfile, advisory, and provenance metadata;
- live agent/network execution and production trace collection; and
- sibling repositories.

Existence, absence, or timestamps in an excluded region may be recorded as inventory context. They do not become semantic facts about an analyzed source snapshot.

---

## 5. Workspaces and TypeScript project contexts

### 5.1 Workspace inventory

The root is a private ESM workspace using Bun globs `packages/*` and `apps/*` (`package.json:2-9`). The observed expansion is:

| Class | Members |
| --- | --- |
| RPH package workspaces | `rph-application`, `rph-assurance`, `rph-authoring`, `rph-contracts`, `rph-domain`, `rph-engine`, `rph-persistence`, `rph-ports`, `rph-product-realization-pwa`, `rph-projections` |
| Shared configuration workspace | `typescript-config` |
| App workspace | `rph-demo` |

The root declares Bun `1.3.14` and Node `>=22` (`package.json:40-48`).

### 5.2 Package compiler contexts

The shared base enables strict NodeNext/ES2022 TypeScript with declarations, declaration maps, source maps, isolated modules, unchecked-index protection, implicit-override checks, and fallthrough checks (`packages/typescript-config/base.json:4-22`).

Each RPH package has:

- a normal `tsconfig.json` that includes `src`, uses `rootDir: src`, and emits to `dist`; and
- a `tsconfig.build.json` that excludes `*.test.ts` and `__tests__` fixtures.

Contracts, domain, engine, and Product Realization PWA build contexts also exclude `src/gen/**`. The normal contexts still include tests and generators. Representative evidence is `packages/rph-contracts/tsconfig.json:1-8` and `packages/rph-contracts/tsconfig.build.json:1-4`.

### 5.3 Root and app contexts

Root `tsconfig.json` extends the shared base but has empty `include` and `files` (`tsconfig.json:1-8`). It is not a root compiler project.

The app context:

- extends `./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`;
- enables `allowJs`, `checkJs`, strict mode, and bundler resolution (`apps/rph-demo/tsconfig.json:1-13`);
- includes Vite configuration, `src/**/*.js`, `src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.svelte`, and conventional `test`/`tests` roots in the recorded generated file (`.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json:30-55`);
- does not include app-root Playwright configurations, `e2e`, `e2e-live`, or static JavaScript.

Consequently, package support is project-declared; app support is configured-but-freshness-unverified; root verification/mutation and Playwright surfaces remain partial or inventory-only.

## 6. Package dependency graph and constraint mapping

### 6.1 Declared runtime workspace graph

| Workspace | Declared runtime workspace dependencies | Representative manifest evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rph-contracts` | None | `packages/rph-contracts/package.json` |
| `rph-ports` | contracts | `packages/rph-ports/package.json:26-30` |
| `rph-domain` | contracts | `packages/rph-domain/package.json:29-34` |
| `rph-assurance` | contracts, domain, ports | `packages/rph-assurance/package.json:26-32` |
| `rph-persistence` | contracts, ports | `packages/rph-persistence/package.json:26-32` |
| `rph-projections` | contracts, domain, ports | `packages/rph-projections/package.json:26-32` |
| `rph-application` | assurance, contracts, domain, ports, projections | `packages/rph-application/package.json:26-35`; persistence is development-only |
| `rph-engine` | application, assurance, contracts, domain, persistence, ports, projections | `packages/rph-engine/package.json:27-38`; Product Realization PWA is development-only |
| `rph-authoring` | contracts, engine | `packages/rph-authoring/package.json:32-39`; assurance and Product Realization PWA are development-only |
| `rph-product-realization-pwa` | contracts | `packages/rph-product-realization-pwa/package.json:29-33` |
| `rph-demo` | authoring, engine, Product Realization PWA, projections | `apps/rph-demo/package.json:20-36` |

### 6.2 Lexically observed package edges

A read-only lexical scan of non-test, non-generator package TypeScript found no workspace import edge absent from the declaring package's manifest.

Representative observed edges include:

- application to assurance at `packages/rph-application/src/handlers/assurance.ts:14`;
- application to contracts and ports at `packages/rph-application/src/command-bus.ts:18-21`;
- application to domain at `packages/rph-application/src/handlers/execution.ts:46`;
- application to projections at `packages/rph-application/src/handlers/pwa-authoring.ts:22`;
- authoring to contracts and engine at `packages/rph-authoring/src/broker.ts:18-33`;
- engine to application at `packages/rph-engine/src/engine.ts:13`;
- engine to contracts, persistence, and ports at `packages/rph-engine/src/engine.ts:20-22`;
- engine to assurance at `packages/rph-engine/src/record-assurance.ts:9`;
- engine to projections at `packages/rph-engine/src/professional-work-graph.ts:12`;
- persistence to contracts and ports at `packages/rph-persistence/src/sqlite-storage-adapter.ts:1-9`;
- ports to contracts at `packages/rph-ports/src/ports/storage.ts:6`;
- Product Realization PWA to contracts at `packages/rph-product-realization-pwa/src/ontology.types.ts:21`; and
- projections to contracts and domain at `packages/rph-projections/src/pwu-behavior.ts:4-5`.

The scan did not observe runtime source imports for four declared edges:

- assurance to domain;
- assurance to ports;
- engine to domain; and
- projections to ports.

These are dependency-hygiene observations. Lexical non-use is not proof that an edge is forbidden, that type-only/build/test consumers are absent, or that removing the declaration is safe.

### 6.3 Configured architecture rules

`.dependency-cruiser.cjs:7-63` configures:

- no circular dependencies;
- no unresolvable dependencies;
- contracts as a foundation;
- domain purity;
- ports purity;
- projections browser safety; and
- no app/UI import into core packages.

It excludes dependency and derived-output regions, consumes root TypeScript configuration, follows TypeScript pre-compilation dependencies, and resolves workspace packages to source using export conditions (`.dependency-cruiser.cjs:65-76`).

The root command is `depcruise packages --config .dependency-cruiser.cjs` (`package.json:18`). Therefore:

- the configured rule subject is `packages`, not app, scripts, or verification roots;
- the configuration is evidence that rules exist, not evidence that they passed at this snapshot;
- rule comments that say a package may depend “only” on a set are stronger than several negative-path regular expressions; and
- no explicit accepted-exception registry was found.

### 6.4 Repository-recorded intended architecture

`docs/JPWB Implementation Roadmap and Tracker.md` declares itself a living document (`:3-8`). It records intended package responsibilities and dependencies at `:82-96`. Differences from manifests and imports are cataloged in §15. They are not silently treated as architecture violations because this inventory does not adjudicate the tracker's authority or currency.

## 7. Source, generated, test, configuration, vendor, and derived counts

### 7.1 Package and app counts

| Artifact class | Recorded count | Classification note |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Package TypeScript under `packages/*/src` | 243 | Includes production, test, generator, and checked-in generated TypeScript |
| Package `*.test.ts` | 141 | Test |
| Package fixtures under `__tests__` | 4 | Test support |
| Package generator TypeScript under `src/gen` | 6 | Generator source |
| Projected package build TypeScript | 92 | Arithmetic classification after 145 test-classified and 6 generator files |
| Checked-in generated TypeScript outputs | 5 | Generated source, listed in §8 |
| Contract vocabulary JSON inputs | 3 | Generator input |
| Generated JSON schemas | 107 | Generated contract output |
| App TypeScript under `src` | 57 | Includes 19 unit tests |
| App Svelte files under `src` | 11 | Framework source |
| App JavaScript under `src` | 0 | None observed |
| Static executable app JavaScript | 1 | `static/theme-init.js`; inventory-only |
| Excluded workflow-runtime JavaScript | 1 | `harness/pwa-judge-panel.workflow.js` |
| Deterministic Playwright files | 28 | Inventory-only test surface |
| Live Playwright files | 2 | Inventory-only live/network surface |
| Root verification tests | 3 | Inventory-only because root project is empty |

Counts describe file classifications, not semantic coverage, test-case count, execution, or correctness.

### 7.2 Derived and vendor observations

Ignored `coverage`, `apps/rph-demo/e2e-results`, package `dist`, `.turbo`, and `.svelte-kit` regions existed during inspection. Their presence and timestamps do not identify:

- the source or commit that produced them;
- the command, environment, provider, or version that produced them;
- whether execution completed;
- whether outputs passed validation;
- whether an ignored artifact is stale; or
- whether it was modified concurrently.

They are `OBSERVED_UNVERIFIED_DERIVED_OUTPUT`, not evidence of recorded-subject success.

---

## 8. Contract and generation inventory

### 8.1 Inputs, generators, and outputs

`rph-contracts` ships `dist` and `schemas` and declares generation commands in `packages/rph-contracts/package.json:24-36`.

| Concern | Input or generator | Checked-in output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Closed vocabularies/enums | `vocab/canonical-vocabulary.json`; `src/gen/gen-enums.ts` | `src/enums.ts` |
| Object contracts | `vocab/m1-object-fields.json`; `src/gen/gen-objects.ts` | `src/objects.ts` |
| Commands and events | `vocab/m3-commands-events.json`; `src/gen/gen-messages.ts` | `src/messages.ts` |
| JSON Schema | generated Zod contracts; `src/gen/emit.ts` | 107 files under `schemas/**` |
| Domain transitions | transition source consumed by `rph-domain/src/gen/gen-transitions.ts` | `rph-domain/src/transitions.data.ts` |
| Product Realization ontology | ontology inputs consumed by `rph-product-realization-pwa/src/gen/gen-ontology.ts` | `rph-product-realization-pwa/src/ontology.data.ts` |

The five generated TypeScript outputs contain generated-file headers. Generation and formatting commands are write-producing and were not run.

### 8.2 Precision and provenance limits

Recorded-snapshot generated `packages/rph-contracts/src/objects.ts:65-111` contains 24 helper schemas expressed as `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())`.

`packages/rph-contracts/src/gen/gen-messages.ts:42-66` permits an unknown enum reference to fall back to `z.string()`.

`packages/rph-contracts/vocab/m3-commands-events.json` contains 161 occurrences of `UNRATIFIED-AUTHORED`, including examples at lines 349, 636, 770, and 824.

The application event gate validates generated `RATIFIED_EVENT_PAYLOADS`; event types outside that map pass unchecked by design (`packages/rph-application/src/handlers/kit.ts:281-328`).

Domain traceability direction checking permits unknown relation names because its edge vocabulary is open (`packages/rph-domain/src/traceability.ts:99-106`).

These are precision and provenance limits. This document does not decide whether a permissive shape is a defect, whether an authored contract should be ratified, or which change would be valid.

## 9. Build, type, lint, test, coverage, mutation, boundary, and gate surfaces

### 9.1 Root command map

| Command | Configured role | Selection or output boundary | Execution state in this preparation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bun run build` | Turborepo workspace build | Package `dist`; app Vite build | Not run |
| `bun run check-types` | Turborepo project diagnostics | Workspace `check-types` scripts | Not run |
| `bun run lint` | ESLint correctness checks | ESLint-supported JS/TS outside ignores | Not run |
| `bun run test` | Turborepo artifact-oriented tests | Package export maps resolve cross-package imports to built artifacts; app has its own Vitest project | Not run |
| `bun run gen` | Workspace generation | Generated source and schemas; uncached | Not run |
| `bun run format` | Prettier write | `**/*.ts` subject after ignores | Not run |
| `bun run format:check` | Prettier check | Same declared TypeScript pattern | Not run |
| `bun run boundary` | dependency-cruiser rules | `packages` only | Not run |
| `bun run test:src` | Root source-resolution Vitest | Ten RPH package projects plus `verif` | Not run |
| `bun run test:coverage` | Root source-mode V8 coverage | Package source only | Not run |
| `bun run mutants:preflight` | Declared-mutant anchor and compile applicability | Selected ledger entries | Not run; not measurement even if run |

| `bun run gate:fast` | Composite type/lint/boundary/build/test/coverage/app-check/E2E command | Multiple configured surfaces | Not run |
| `bun run gate` | `gate:fast` plus mutation | Multiple configured surfaces | Not run |

The exact root scripts are at `package.json:10-24`. Turborepo makes build depend on dependency builds, gives build a `dist/**` output, makes type/test depend on dependency builds, and marks generation uncached (`turbo.json:4-25`).

### 9.2 Resolved tool identities

The lockfile resolves:

| Tool or runtime library | Resolved version | Lockfile evidence |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| TypeScript | `5.9.3` | `bun.lock:1163` |
| ESLint | `9.39.5` | `bun.lock:771` |
| typescript-eslint | `8.63.0` | `bun.lock:1165` |
| dependency-cruiser | `16.10.4` | `bun.lock:747` |
| Vitest | `4.1.10` | `bun.lock:1181` |
| `@vitest/coverage-v8` | `4.1.10` | `bun.lock:621` |
| Playwright | `1.61.1` | `bun.lock:415` |
| SvelteKit | `2.69.2` | `bun.lock:549` |
| Svelte | `5.56.4` | `bun.lock:1123` |
| `svelte-check` | `4.7.2` | `bun.lock:1125` |
| Vite, app resolution | `7.3.6` | `bun.lock:1177` |
| Vite, nested Vitest resolution | `8.1.4` | `bun.lock:1253` |
| Turborepo | `2.10.4` | `bun.lock:1157` |
| Prettier | `3.9.5` | `bun.lock:1045` |
| Zod | `4.4.3` | `bun.lock:1205` |
| better-sqlite3 | `12.11.1` | `bun.lock:675` |

These are installed-resolution identities in the lockfile, not CSAA provider approvals.

### 9.3 Compiler and build roles

Package `build` scripts invoke `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`; package `check-types` scripts invoke `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`; package `test` scripts invoke Vitest (`packages/rph-application/package.json:21-24` is representative).

Every RPH package exports a `source` condition and `dist` types/import/default targets (`packages/rph-application/package.json:8-19` is representative). Contracts adds `./hash` (`packages/rph-contracts/package.json:8-26`); authoring adds browser-safe `./catalog` (`packages/rph-authoring/package.json:8-20`).

The compiler is configured to validate project contexts and emit build artifacts. No authored code was found using the TypeScript Compiler API to populate a CSAA semantic snapshot.

### 9.4 Artifact and source test roles

Root `vitest.config.ts:24-35` explicitly preserves two roles:

- `bun run test` validates shipped build artifacts and export/emit boundaries; and
- `bun run test:src` resolves workspace imports to source for attribution, coverage, and mutation.

The root source configuration aliases package and subpath imports to `src` and defines one `verif` project plus ten package projects (`vitest.config.ts:53-102`).

The presence of both modes is a configured cross-check. Neither mode was executed by this inventory, so no source/artifact agreement result is claimed.

### 9.5 Coverage identity

The configured root coverage collection is:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Provider | V8 via `@vitest/coverage-v8@4.1.10` |
| Resolution mode | Source |
| Test selection | Root Vitest projects: `verif` plus ten RPH packages |
| Subject include | `packages/*/src/**/*.ts` |
| Exclusions | Tests, `__tests__`, `src/gen`, selected generated contracts, domain transitions, declarations, barrels |
| Reporters | `text`, `json-summary`, `html` |
| Output | `./coverage` |
| Threshold scope | Global; no `perFile` setting |
| Thresholds | Statements `94.5`; branches `82.5`; functions `95.5`; lines `96.5` |
| Automatic update | `false` |
| App coverage | Absent |
| LCOV/Sonar ingestion | Absent |

Evidence is `vitest.config.ts:103-120,138-145`.

`rph-product-realization-pwa/src/ontology.data.ts` is generated but is not among the explicit generated-output coverage exclusions. That affects the configured denominator and is reported as an observation, not silently corrected.

### 9.6 ESLint, Svelte, and static analysis

ESLint:

- ignores dependency, derived, documentation, and harness regions;
- applies recommended JavaScript and TypeScript configurations;
- treats explicit `any` as a warning;
- treats unused variables as errors;
- has switch exhaustiveness disabled; and
- relaxes explicit-any and non-null-assertion rules in tests.

Evidence is `eslint.config.mjs:1-49`.

No Svelte parser, security plugin, or type-aware TypeScript project service is configured in ESLint. SvelteKit and `svelte-check` own app framework diagnostics; Vite/Svelte owns app compilation (`apps/rph-demo/package.json:7-18`; `apps/rph-demo/svelte.config.js:1-12`).

`sonar-project.properties:1-12` selects package sources/tests and TypeScript config paths. No checked-in Sonar runner command, dependency, workflow step, or coverage-ingestion property was found.

No direct dependency or checked-in configuration was found for ts-morph, Semgrep, CodeQL, Joern, Tree-sitter, or Stryker. Their absence prevents a claim of recorded-snapshot capability; it does not select any of them for later use.

### 9.7 CI and composite commands

`.github/workflows/ci.yml:1-30` runs:

- frozen Bun install;
- build;
- type-check;
- lint;
- dependency boundary;
- format check; and
- Turborepo test.

It does not invoke root source-mode tests, coverage, mutation, `gate`, app `check`, deterministic E2E, live E2E, or Sonar.

Because Turborepo traverses workspace build and test scripts, CI still reaches app build/test surfaces configured as workspace tasks. That is not equivalent to invoking the root composite gate.

---

## 10. Mutation and root verification instruments

### 10.1 Ledger identity and denominator

The declared ledger at `scripts/mutants/ledger.ts` contains:

| Entry classification | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Total entries with stable IDs | 96 |
| Declared duplicates | 10 |
| Superseded/retired entries | 4 |
| Expected compile prevention | 2 |
| Expected-survive controls | 2 |
| Non-retired, non-duplicate distinct entries | 82 |

The 82 distinct entries comprise 78 ordinary test mutations, two type-prevention checks, and two controls.

The ledger expressly disclaims total mutation-space coverage and names generated mutation as a future, out-of-scope successor (`scripts/mutants/ledger.ts:66-68`).

### 10.2 Runner behavior

The runner:

- targets source resolution;
- checks anchors and compile applicability in preflight;
- declares that preflight is not measurement;
- chooses named victim suites or the whole workspace;
- compiles the mutated package before test execution;
- journals and applies one source mutation;
- runs Vitest;
- restores the original file in `finally`;
- reports duplicates and retired entries outside the measured denominator; and
- blocks by default on survivor, unanchored, no-compile, or dirty-abort verdicts.

Evidence is `scripts/mutants/run.ts:1-24,40-50,159-262,357-427`.

Its tracked-cleanliness check ignores untracked paths and is limited to `packages`, `apps`, and `verif` (`run.ts:61-80`).

Crash recovery reads the journal and executes `git checkout -- <file>` before the subsequent dirty-tree refusal (`run.ts:288-313`). If a legitimate intervening edit were made to the journaled path after a killed run, recovery could discard it. This is an instrument-safety observation, not evidence that the loss occurred in this snapshot.

### 10.3 Self-checking verification files

The root verification files configure checks for:

- ledger identifier, duplicate, successor, rationale, and provenance coherence (`verif/mutant-ledger.test.ts:32-91`);
- source versus artifact module identity and behavioral agreement (`verif/source-resolution.test.ts:38-79`); and
- a non-vacuous reviewable-source walk with no NUL bytes (`verif/source-is-reviewable.test.ts:24-53`).

Because root `tsconfig.json` has no files, these are Vitest-executed inventory surfaces rather than compiler-project-supported source under the first static subject.

---

## 11. Runtime, test, and framework entry points

### 11.1 Package and engine entry points

The package barrels are:

- application `src/index.ts:3-16`;
- assurance `src/index.ts:3-10`;
- authoring `src/index.ts:4-8`;
- contracts `src/index.ts:8-17`;
- domain `src/index.ts:3-18`;
- engine `src/index.ts:3-12`;
- persistence `src/index.ts:4-10`;
- ports `src/index.ts:4-8`;
- Product Realization PWA `src/index.ts:4-6`; and
- projections `src/index.ts:3-19`.

`EngineHandle` exposes dispatch, atomic/guarded batches, subscription, outbox drain/recovery, object/event reads, fork, ontology, and close (`packages/rph-engine/src/engine.ts:86-116`).

`createEngine` validates root cardinality and optional ontology validation, then defaults to a SQLite storage adapter when none is injected (`engine.ts:118-164`).

### 11.2 App route entry points

Observed filesystem routes include:

- home load/actions at `apps/rph-demo/src/routes/+page.server.ts:7,22`;
- Undertakings load/actions at `routes/undertakings/+page.server.ts:10,50`;
- Undertaking detail load/actions at `routes/undertakings/[id]/+page.server.ts:184,470`;
- baselines load/actions at `routes/baselines/+page.server.ts:21,32`;
- decisions load/actions at `routes/decisions/+page.server.ts:14,25`;
- PWA detail load/actions at `routes/pwa/[id]/+page.server.ts:77,307`;
- test-only reset, dispatch, and introspection endpoints; and
- the authoring-agent SSE endpoint at `routes/pwa/[id]/agent/+server.ts:279-400`.

The route list is a framework-discovery inventory. It is not a complete call graph or reachability proof.

### 11.3 Playwright entry points

Deterministic Playwright configuration uses:

- `e2e` and `*.e2e.ts`;
- one worker;
- one retry;
- system Edge;
- JSON results and artifact directories;
- retained-on-failure traces;
- failure screenshots; and
- a test-mode SvelteKit server.

Evidence is `apps/rph-demo/playwright.config.ts:18-46`.

Live Playwright configuration isolates `e2e-live`, `*.live.ts`, zero retries, longer timeouts, different output paths, and `JPWB_AGENT=pi` (`playwright.live.config.ts:3-36`).

Playwright outputs and traces are distinct from source coverage. Neither surface was executed.

---

## 12. Dynamic loading, generation, reflection, and external seams

### 12.1 Observed dynamic imports

The app layout path dynamically imports Stately graph, ELK layout, and xyflow adapters, with an explicit Dagre fallback on import or execution failure (`apps/rph-demo/src/lib/pwaFlow.ts:290-337`).

The authoring-agent factory returns a deterministic mock or dynamically imports the live Pi adapter (`apps/rph-demo/src/lib/server/agent/index.ts:1-33`). Mode selection is environment/test controlled (`workbench.ts:217-225`).

### 12.2 Framework and native seams

Vite:

- uses `createRequire` to resolve the exact `elkjs` browser bundle;
- enables workspace `source` export conditions;
- compiles workspace source; and
- externalizes `better-sqlite3` from SSR bundles.

Evidence is `apps/rph-demo/vite.config.ts:1-28`.

SvelteKit performs filesystem route discovery and generates project context. better-sqlite3 is a native runtime dependency behind the persistence adapter.

### 12.3 External model/reviewer seam

The reasoning-review adapter invokes an external `agy` executable with:

- an environment-configurable binary;
- explicit/default model resolution;
- a 28,000-character argument budget;
- `execFile`;
- a 240-second timeout; and
- a 16 MiB buffer.

Evidence is `apps/rph-demo/src/lib/server/assurance/agy-cli.ts:1-55`.

The Pi and agy seams may involve credentials, processes, and networks. Their configuration was inspected; they were not invoked or health-verified.

### 12.4 Bounded reflection observation

No `eval`, `new Function`, Proxy/Reflect dispatch, or TypeScript Compiler API import was found in the inspected authored non-derived TypeScript/JavaScript subject.

This is a bounded lexical observation. It does not prove the absence of:

- framework-generated dispatch;
- package-internal reflection;
- native-module behavior;
- dynamically constructed module identifiers;
- third-party reflection; or
- runtime paths outside the first subject.

---

## 13. Representative success and failure paths

### 13.1 Command success path

The observed representative path is:

1. A SvelteKit action creates a command envelope and invokes single or atomic dispatch (`apps/rph-demo/src/lib/server/workbench.ts:110-168`).
2. The command bus logs ingress, performs idempotency handling, validates the command contract, and selects a handler (`packages/rph-application/src/command-bus.ts:84-160`).
3. The handler validates produced state and applicable event payload, then assembles state, event, outbox, and receipt (`packages/rph-application/src/handlers/kit.ts:250-350`).
4. The SQLite adapter checks optimistic revision and atomically writes current state, version, event, outbox message, and receipt (`packages/rph-persistence/src/sqlite-storage-adapter.ts:114-215`).
5. The handler logs acceptance and returns the event identity (`handlers/kit.ts:350-376`).
6. The outbox delivers to subscribers/projections and marks messages published (`command-bus.ts:255-277`).
7. A route or projection supplies derived state to the UI.

This is a source-grounded flow narrative, not an executed trace.

### 13.2 Failure and degraded paths

Observed failure paths include:

- malformed ontology fails during engine construction (`packages/rph-engine/src/engine.ts:127-139`);
- unknown command, invalid command payload, or missing handler returns rejection/validation failure (`packages/rph-application/src/command-bus.ts:118-152`);
- a failed member aborts an atomic batch (`command-bus.ts:163-187`);
- revision conflict returns no produced event and a typed conflict (`handlers/kit.ts:349-365`);
- ELK import/execution failure logs a warning and uses Dagre (`apps/rph-demo/src/lib/pwaFlow.ts:334-336`);
- the agent SSE route records error material, cleans the staged candidate, and closes the stream (`routes/pwa/[id]/agent/+server.ts:370-390`); and
- mutation-runner preflight or execution has explicit rot, survivor, contamination, and recovery outcomes.

---

## 14. Observability, events, coverage, and runtime traces

### 14.1 Diagnostic logging

The `Logger` port is the engine's diagnostic seam. Its contract states:

- the host chooses the sink;
- the default is no-op;
- records are leveled and structured; and
- records must not carry secrets, PII, or raw payloads.

It distinguishes diagnostic logs from durable domain events and Assurance Observations (`packages/rph-ports/src/ports/logger.ts:1-7,20-33`). Defaults provide no-op, injected-sink, and JSON-console implementations (`packages/rph-ports/src/defaults/logger.ts:27-73`).

### 14.2 Durable event and trace identity

Object provenance and command/event correlation and causation are declared in `packages/rph-contracts/src/envelopes.ts:34-64,70-110`.

The SQLite schema records:

- current professional-work objects;
- object versions;
- domain events with global sequence, correlation, causation, and command identity;
- outbox messages; and
- idempotency receipts.

Evidence is `packages/rph-persistence/src/schema.ts:1-74`.

The traceability projection folds typed links from domain events and carries no command authority (`packages/rph-projections/src/traceability-view.ts:1-8,37-93`).

The app records authoring conversation entries through engine commands as event-sourced domain state (`apps/rph-demo/src/lib/server/workbench.ts:171-214`).

### 14.3 Absent production-observation capabilities

No authored:

- OpenTelemetry pipeline;
- metrics backend;
- production trace ingester;
- trace-retention/sampling policy;
- service health/readiness endpoint; or
- revision-bound runtime-trace corpus

was found in the first subject.

The repository roadmap delegates OTel, metrics, and service health to a future host and treats events/observations as library telemetry (`docs/JPWB Implementation Roadmap and Tracker.md:416-435`).

Under `CSAA-005-REQ-047` and `CSAA-005-REQ-259` through `CSAA-005-REQ-262`, Playwright trace configuration, V8 coverage, durable events, structured diagnostic logs, and production traces remain different evidence classes.

---

## 15. Recorded-snapshot conformance mapping and open observations

### 15.1 Conformance mapping

| Concern | Recorded-snapshot repository evidence | Recorded-snapshot mapping | Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace discovery | Root manifest and workspace directories | Configured and enumerated | Snapshot-bound |
| TypeScript strictness | Shared base and package projects | Configured | Commands unexecuted |
| Package build separation | Normal/build configs | Configured | Build unexecuted |
| Package architecture | Manifests and dependency-cruiser rules | Configured | Rule command unexecuted; subject limited |
| Artifact/source test distinction | Package exports and root Vitest config | Configured | Neither mode executed |
| Unit/integration tests | Package/app tests | Present | No recorded-snapshot pass claim |
| Root coverage | V8 config | Configured | Package-only; no recorded-snapshot measurement |
| Mutation | Declared ledger and runner | Present and bounded | Not run; not total mutant space |
| App diagnostics | SvelteKit/Svelte check config | Configured, generated-context-qualified | Sync/check unexecuted |
| Deterministic UI testing | Playwright config and files | Present | Inventory-only; unexecuted |
| Live agent testing | Separate Playwright live config and files | Present | Excluded, networked, unexecuted |
| Static quality | ESLint and Sonar config | Partially configured | No verified Sonar runner; no security analyzer |
| Durable behavior evidence | Events, versions, outbox, receipts, observations | Implemented source paths present | No execution trace captured here |
| CSAA semantic graphs | No implementation found | Unsupported | Later design/qualification required |
| CSAA finding/gate records | No implementation found | Unsupported | Reserved to later documents |

### 15.2 Open observations, not Analyzer Finding Records

These records are descriptive inventory observations. They have no authoritative severity, waiver, suppression, or gate effect.

| Observation ID | Open observation | Confidence | Routing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-001` | Root TypeScript configuration contains no files, leaving root Vitest/mutation/verification TypeScript outside a declared compiler project | High | Project-context design and later CSAA support decision |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-002` | App project identity depends on ignored generated SvelteKit configuration whose freshness is unproved | High | App build/check evidence owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-003` | Coverage is package-source-only, global-only, lacks LCOV/Sonar ingestion, omits app coverage, and does not explicitly exclude generated `ontology.data.ts` | High | Existing repository gate owner; later rule/gate owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-004` | CI is narrower than `gate:fast`/`gate` and does not invoke source tests, coverage, mutation, app check, E2E, or Sonar | High | CI/gate concern owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-005` | dependency-cruiser scans packages only and several “only” comments are stronger than their negative regular expressions | High | Architecture-rule owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-006` | No accepted-exception registry was found for dependency rules | High | Architecture-rule and later exception owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-007` | Sonar is configured but no checked-in runner, workflow step, or coverage ingestion was found | High | Static-analysis/gate owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-008` | No security analyzer basis found in the recorded snapshot supports a “no vulnerability” conclusion | High | Later rule/provider/conformance owners |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-009` | Contracts contain 24 permissive record helpers, 161 `UNRATIFIED-AUTHORED` labels, unknown-enum fallback, selectively validated event shapes, and open relation names | High | Contract and governance concern owners |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-010` | Mutation evidence is limited to the declared ledger; runner recovery can overwrite an intervening edit to a journaled file | High | Verification-instrument owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-011` | Declared runtime dependency edges assurance→domain, assurance→ports, engine→domain, and projections→ports had no observed non-test/non-generator source import | Medium | Package-maintenance owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-012` | Live Pi, agy, network, production traces, and ignored result outputs are unverified | High | Host/runtime evidence owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-013` | At the recorded snapshot, the Ports barrel exported Logger and Storage only, while the living roadmap named additional intended ports | High | Port architecture concern owner |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-014` | No checked-in CSAA AST/symbol/type/call/CFG/DFG/taint/CPG analyzer or Analyzer Finding Record implementation exists | High | Later CSAA documents and qualification |
| `CSAA-005-OBS-015` | Bounded lexical inspection found no undeclared package runtime edge or reflection/eval, but cannot close compiler, framework, native, or runtime dispatch | Medium | Future semantic analyzer |

### 15.3 Roadmap and implementation divergence

The living roadmap at `docs/JPWB Implementation Roadmap and Tracker.md:82-96`:

- names `rph-controller` and development-only `rph-conformance`, neither of which exists;
- states persistence depends on domain, while the recorded-snapshot manifest/source graph does not;
- states application depends on persistence, while the recorded-snapshot runtime code consumes the port and the package has persistence only as development dependency;
- states projections depends on persistence, while the recorded-snapshot manifest/source graph does not; and
- describes engine as depending on all RPH packages except the Product Realization PWA.

The roadmap later says the engine-to-projections dependency was dropped (`:373-376`), while the recorded-snapshot `rph-engine/package.json:27-34` and `rph-engine/src/professional-work-graph.ts:12` contain that dependency.

It also records TypeScript `^6`, ESLint `^10`, and Sonar wired from M0 (`:69,74,437`), while recorded-snapshot resolution is TypeScript `5.9.3`, ESLint `9.39.5`, and the recorded-snapshot CI has no Sonar step.

These differences establish documentation/configuration divergence. They do not establish which source should change.

---

## 16. Recorded-snapshot semantic-analysis capability boundary

At the recorded snapshot, the repository supported conventional compiler, lint, dependency, test, coverage, mutation, framework-check, UI-test, and event/log evidence surfaces.

The recorded snapshot did not implement the CSAA semantic model described by `JAN-CSAA-002`. Specifically, no checked-in capability was found in that snapshot for:

- provenance-preserving AST ingestion;
- compiler-context-bound symbol/reference indexes;
- materialized type graphs;
- static or hybrid call graphs;
- control-flow graphs;
- data-flow or taint graphs;
- a code property graph or equivalent graph composition;
- semantic before/after deltas;
- provider disagreement records;
- analysis-support and completeness declarations;
- Analyzer Finding Records;
- Repository Gate Profiles or Evaluations; or
- append-only CSAA finding history.

TypeScript, ESLint, dependency-cruiser, Vitest, V8 coverage, Playwright, Sonar configuration, and the mutation runner may later provide evidence through qualified adapters. This Draft neither selects them for that role nor assumes the observed snapshot output satisfies a future contract.

---

## 17. Provenance, confidence, and uncertainty

### 17.1 Confidence classes

| Class | Meaning in this inventory |
| --- | --- |
| High | Direct Git identity, file bytes, manifest/configuration text, enumerated path/count, or exact static field occurrence |
| Medium | Bounded lexical relationship or absence observation that lacks compiler/runtime closure |
| Unverified | Configured execution, ignored derived output, live/external capability, or result not independently executed |
| Unsupported | Required semantic capability for which no recorded-snapshot implementation was found |

### 17.2 Method limits

The inventory used Git, filesystem, manifest, configuration, lockfile, and source inspection. Package import edges were identified lexically after excluding tests, `__tests__`, and generator directories. Named-tool absence was searched within the explicit tracked subject and relevant root configuration.

The method did not:

- resolve TypeScript symbols;
- build a compiler Program;
- execute code;
- follow runtime dispatch;
- analyze third-party source;
- inspect production systems;
- collect traces;
- query an advisory service; or
- prove security absence.

### 17.3 No-execution statement

This preparation did not run installation, formatting, generation, build, SvelteKit sync, compiler, Svelte check, lint, dependency analysis, tests, coverage, mutation, Playwright, Sonar, another external analyzer, live agent/network execution, production trace collection, or any command intended to write caches or derived artifacts.

A checked-in command is configuration evidence only. Repository comments or roadmap pass claims are repository-recorded claims, not independently repeated verification.

---

## 18. Normative requirement catalog

These stable IDs are candidate requirements only while this document remains Draft. This corrected catalog contains 336 independently dispositionable clauses: 261 `SHALL` clauses and 75 `SHALL NOT` clauses. Every row has exactly one modal predicate and one verification grain. Existing IDs retain their first clause; every separated clause receives a new, non-reusable ID.

### 18.1 Authority and subject identity

### 18.7 Inherited obligation intake

The requirement ledger imports the following seventy individually identified obligations from `JAN-CSAA-000@0.3.0`. Their exact source wording, including controlling conditions and enumerated fields, applicability, local mapping, and open verification state are preserved there rather than weakened into local paraphrase:

| Inherited source IDs | Count | Local concern and substantive site |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-051`–`052` | 2 | Revision-specific tooling-role verification and non-selection boundary; §§9, 15–16 |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-145`–`150` | 6 | Permanent identity, version/status/authority separation, and manifest synchronization; metadata and §20 |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-151` | 1 | Controlled filename convention; filename and metadata |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-152`–`163` | 12 | Required controlled-document and inventory-specific metadata; metadata and §§2–3 |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-164`–`168` | 5 | Conferral, transition, separation-of-duties, independent review, and adoption-package controls; metadata, ledger, §§19–20 |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-380`–`404` | 25 | Evidence-first repository inventory scope and exact tool-role/coverage verification; §§3–17 |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-642`–`652` | 11 | Documentation-only Wave 1 boundary, experiment prohibition, and exit boundary; metadata, §§1–2, 16, 20 |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-737`–`739` | 3 | Activated Wave 1 authoring and adversarial-review commission; metadata, ledger, §§19–20 |
| `CSAA-000-REQ-745`–`749` | 5 | Controlled lifecycle-state meanings; metadata and §20 |
| **Total** | **70** | Individually dispositioned in the requirement ledger |

Direct stable-ID deontic intake from `JPWB-CON-000` and `JPWB-DOC-001` through `JPWB-DOC-004` remains `OPEN`. Those authorities are cited for their owned concerns, but this Draft does not claim complete direct-source equivalence or silently treat the `JAN-CSAA-000` allocation as a substitute for concern-owner review.

### 18.8 Atomic split trace

### 18.9 Frozen preparation-evidence obligation equivalence

The frozen [Preparation Evidence Snapshot](<records/JAN-CSAA-005 - Preparation Evidence Snapshot.md>) remains byte-for-byte unchanged. Its line 438 contains one historical `SHALL` sentence with four independently verifiable actions. The successor IDs below provide the controlled local judgment grain without rewriting, invalidating, or granting independent authority to that evidence record:

| Frozen source location | Preserved source sentence | Successor local IDs | Equivalence status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `JAN-CSAA-005-EVIDENCE-001@0.1.0`, line 438 | Before Proposed promotion, the reviewer SHALL require a fresh revision/worktree/configuration observation and compare conclusion-bearing fields. | `CSAA-005-REQ-333`–`CSAA-005-REQ-336` | Exact four-action successor decomposition; evidence bytes unchanged |

## 19. Verification allocation

| Verification target | Current verification route | Status for this Draft |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata and authority boundary | Controlled-document review against `JAN-CSAA-000` and `REG-D-018` | Author self-check pending |
| Revision/worktree identity | Preparation evidence snapshot, Git re-observation, and Refresh Blocker Record | Initial evidence recorded; current-subject refresh blocked |
| Workspace/project inventory | Manifest/configuration/path inspection | Initial evidence recorded |
| Dependency graph | Manifest parsing plus bounded source-import inspection | Initial evidence recorded; compiler resolution absent |
| File classifications and counts | Read-only filesystem enumeration | Initial evidence recorded |
| Tool roles and resolved versions | Script/configuration/lockfile inspection | Initial evidence recorded; execution absent |
| Coverage identity | Root Vitest configuration inspection | Initial evidence recorded; measurement absent |
| Mutation identity | Ledger, runner, and self-test inspection | Initial evidence recorded; runner absent |
| Runtime seams and paths | Source inspection | Initial evidence recorded; trace absent |
| Security capability boundary | Named configuration/dependency/source search | Initial bounded absence observation |
| Observation routing | Cross-document and concern-owner review | Pending |
| Local requirement atomicity and substantive mapping | 336-row requirement catalog and requirement ledger | Corrected in this Draft; independent verification not run |
| Inherited `JAN-CSAA-000` intake | Seventy individually identified source rows with exact source wording in the requirement ledger | Recorded; all verification remains not run |
| Direct cited-canon intake | Concern-owner source review against `JPWB-CON-000` and `JPWB-DOC-001` through `004` | Open |
| Requirement closure | Current requirement ledger | Open |
| Adversarial review | Independent reviewer | Not started |

## 20. Draft acceptance state

This `0.1.0` revision remains a prepared, non-authoritative Draft candidate under `REG-D-018`. The subject-independent correction in §18 and the ledger establishes atomic local judgment grain, exact substantive-site equality, full-wording `JAN-CSAA-000` intake, and explicit treatment of the frozen preparation-evidence obligation. It does not refresh or reinterpret the stale repository subject.

This correction changes only this Draft, its requirement ledger, and cross-reference metadata in the Refresh Blocker Record. The original Preparation Evidence Snapshot remains exact historical evidence and is not rewritten or superseded.

The Draft is ready for continued author self-review, but it is not ready for Proposed promotion, exact-candidate independent review, adoption, or closure because:

- direct cited-canon intake remains open for concern-owner review;
- at this Draft freeze, the controlled-manifest conflict remained open; its live state is controlled by any later exact recorded disposition;
- the repository subject remains `STALE_FOR_CURRENT_REPOSITORY`;
- the [Refresh Blocker Record](<records/JAN-CSAA-005 - Refresh Blocker Record.md>) shows that a stable current-subject refresh prerequisite was not met;
- all 406 local and inherited ledger rows remain `PLANNED` and `NOT_RUN`;
- author self-review remains open; and
- formal independent adversarial review has not run.

Draft completion does not confer authority, approve recorded-snapshot or current repository divergence, validate current source, or activate a later wave.

## 21. Closing inventory rule

The inventory is useful only while it remains less ambitious than the evidence:

> Record exactly what exists, exactly what identified subject it belongs to, exactly what configured instruments can and cannot establish, and exactly where judgment or execution is still missing.

Anything stronger belongs to a concern-owning authority and separately qualified evidence.
