# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Overview
This document maps system requirements to their implementation phases, verification methods, and success criteria. Each requirement is given a unique ID and tracked through the development process.

## ID Format
- **AUTH-**: Authentication requirements
- **USER-**: User management requirements
- **API-**: API endpoint requirements
- **SEC-**: Security requirements
- **DB-**: Database requirements
- **SYS-**: System requirements
- **DOC-**: Documentation requirements

## Verification Methods

Each requirement will be verified using one or more of the following methods:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
3. **Manual Testing**: Human verification of functionality
4. **Code Review**: Peer review of implementation
5. **Documentation Review**: Verification of documentation completeness

## Out of Scope Requirements

The following requirements are explicitly marked as out of scope for the MVP:

| Req ID | Requirement Description | Reason for Exclusion |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| PERF-001 | Performance optimization | Not critical for MVP |
| MON-001 | Advanced monitoring | Basic monitoring sufficient for MVP |
| CI-001 | CI/CD pipeline | Manual deployment acceptable for MVP |
| HA-001 | High availability | Single instance sufficient for MVP |
| TEST-001 | Advanced testing infrastructure | Basic testing sufficient for MVP |
| INT-001 | Traefik integration | Will be handled post-MVP |
| DB-005 | Database connection pooling | Basic connection sufficient for MVP |
| SEC-005 | TLS termination | Will be handled by external system post-MVP |
| SYS-005 | Service discovery | Not needed for MVP |
| NET-001 | Advanced networking features | Basic networking sufficient for MVP |

## Success Criteria Mapping

Each requirement's success is measured against specific criteria:

1. **Functionality**: Feature works as specified
2. **Security**: Meets security requirements
3. **Performance**: Meets basic performance needs
4. **Documentation**: Properly documented
5. **Testing**: Has appropriate test coverage

## Status Tracking

Requirements status will be updated throughout development:

- **Not Started**: Implementation not begun
- **In Progress**: Currently being implemented
- **Completed**: Implementation finished
- **Verified**: Tested and confirmed working
- **Documented**: Documentation complete

**Current Progress Summary**:
- Phase 1 (Initial Setup): 100% Complete
- Phase 2 (Core Authentication): 75% Complete (Password reset pending)
- Phase 3 (API Development): 90% Complete (Rate limiting pending)
- Phase 4 (Documentation): 25% Complete
- Phase 5 (Deployment): Basic setup complete, integration items marked as out of scope for MVP
