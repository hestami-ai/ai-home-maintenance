Project Name FastAPI MVP

Secure User Management System
1. Overview

This system provides a secure user management solution and a service marketplace where homeowners can list properties and service providers can showcase their businesses and services. The system includes features for user registration, login, password management, and secure API endpoints.

NOTA BENE: Do not implement sections that are marked "[OUT OF SCOPE FOR MVP]".

2. Functional Requirements
2.1. User Management

    User Registration: Allow users to create accounts with a username, email, and password.
    User Login: Authenticate users using their credentials.
    Password Reset: Enable secure password reset functionality.
    Profile Management: Allow users to update their profile information.

2.2. Role Management

    Homeowners:
        List and manage properties.
        View service provider listings.
    Service Providers:
        List and manage business services.
        View homeowner requests or inquiries.
    Hestami AI Staff:
        Manage user accounts, roles, and permissions.
        Monitor system usage and logs.

2.3. Authentication and Authorization

    Token-Based Authentication: Use JWT (PyJWT) for authentication.
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Restrict access to endpoints based on user roles.
    Secure Password Storage: Hash passwords using bcrypt.

2.4. API Features

    Public and Private Endpoints:
        Public: Registration, login, and password reset.
        Private: Manage properties, services, and profiles.
    Error Handling: Provide meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes.
    Search and Filtering: Allow users to search for properties and services.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1. Security

    HTTPS will be secured using a Traefik reverse proxy and TLS external to this application.
    Implement CORS for cross-origin resource sharing.
    Enforce strong password policies.
    Implement token expiration and revocation for JWTs.
    Validate all inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

3.2. [OUT OF SCOPE FOR MVP] Performance

    Average API response time: <200ms.
    Handle at least 1000 concurrent requests with low latency.

3.3. [OUT OF SCOPE FOR MVP] Scalability

    Horizontally scalable to support increasing users and traffic.
    Use database connection pooling for efficient database operations.

3.4. [OUT OF SCOPE FOR MVP] Availability

    Ensure 99.9% uptime.
    Use a fault-tolerant database configuration.

4. Technical Requirements
4.1. Backend Framework

    FastAPI:
        Provides fast, asynchronous API development.
        Auto-generates OpenAPI documentation.

4.2. Database

    PostgreSQL 17 (run as a separate Docker container):
        Relational database for storing user, property, and service data.
        Use schemas for logical data organization.

4.3. ORM

    SQLAlchemy:
        Abstract database queries using the ORM.
        Use declarative models for defining tables.

4.4. Authentication

    PyJWT:
        Generate and validate secure JWT tokens.
        Implement short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens.

4.5. Password Hashing

    bcrypt:
        Securely hash passwords before storing them.

4.6. Third-Party Libraries

    FastAPI Users:
        Simplify user management, registration, and authentication.
    Pydantic:
        Validate and serialize request and response data.
    Alembic:
        Handle database migrations.

4.7. API Security

    Secure all endpoints with OAuth2PasswordBearer and JWT validation.
    Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

4.8. Deployment

    Containerization: Use Docker for containerized deployments.
    Web Server: Deploy with Uvicorn (ASGI) .
    Traefik is a reverse proxy that is used to secure the API and is deployed as a separate container and not part of the FastAPI application.

5. Development Requirements

5.3. [OUT OF SCOPE FOR MVP] Testing

    Use pytest for unit and integration testing.
    Achieve at least 90% test coverage.

5.4. Documentation

    Auto-generate API documentation using FastAPI's OpenAPI integration.
    Include developer documentation for setup, deployment, and maintenance.
