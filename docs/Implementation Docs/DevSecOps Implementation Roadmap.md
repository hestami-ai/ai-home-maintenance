# DevSecOps Implementation Roadmap for Hestami-AI

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the DevSecOps pipeline described in the DevSecOps Deployment Pipeline document. The goal is to establish a secure, automated CI/CD pipeline for the Hestami-AI project using GitHub Actions and a self-hosted runner.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Server Configuration
- [x] Provision VM with sufficient resources for both dev and prod environments
- [x] Configure firewall to allow only necessary outbound connections
- [x] Install Docker and Docker Compose
- [x] Set up monitoring and logging basics

### 1.2 Network Configuration
- [x] Create the `traefik-public` network
- [x] Create the `backend-dev` network
- [x] Create the `backend-prod` network
- [x] Create the `temporal-network` if needed

### 1.3 Traefik Setup
- [x] Install and configure Traefik v3.2.1
- [x] Set up TLS certificates with appropriate provider
- [x] Configure Traefik to listen only on port 443
- [x] Set up Traefik dashboard with secure access

## Phase 2: Core Configuration Files (Week 2)

### 2.1 Docker Compose Files
- [x] Create/update `compose.common.yaml` with shared services
- [x] Create/update `compose.dev.yaml` with development-specific services
- [x] Create/update `compose.prod.yaml` with production-specific services
- [x] Test each compose file individually

### 2.2 Traefik Configuration
- [x] Create `traefik/dynamic/common.yaml` with security headers
- [x] Configure basic-auth for development environment
- [x] Set up TLS options with minimum TLS 1.2
- [x] Create README.md with htpasswd generation instructions

### 2.3 Environment Files
- [x] Create `.env.local` template for development
- [x] Create `.env.prod` template for production
- [x] Document all required environment variables
- [ ] Set up secure storage for sensitive values

## Phase 3: Deployment Scripts (Week 3)

### 3.1 Deployment Script
- [ ] Create `scripts/deploy.sh` for automated deployments
- [ ] Implement environment detection (dev vs prod)
- [ ] Add image pruning functionality (older than 7 days)
- [ ] Test deployment script with sample images

### 3.2 Runner Setup
- [ ] Create `scripts/runner-install.md` with detailed instructions
- [ ] Set up GitHub self-hosted runner with `dev` label
- [ ] Set up GitHub self-hosted runner with `prod` label
- [ ] Configure runners with appropriate permissions

### 3.3 Makefile
- [ ] Create Makefile with helper commands
- [ ] Add build targets for local development
- [ ] Add scan targets for security testing
- [ ] Add deployment targets for manual operations

## Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline (Week 4)

### 4.1 GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Configure GitHub repository settings
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules for `dev` and `main`
- [ ] Configure GitHub Environments for production
- [ ] Add required secrets to GitHub repository

### 4.2 GitHub Actions Workflow
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/cicd.yml`
- [ ] Configure build-test-scan job
- [ ] Configure deploy-dev job with auto-deployment
- [ ] Configure deploy-prod job with manual approval

### 4.3 Security Scanning
- [ ] Set up Trivy for container scanning
- [ ] Configure Semgrep for SAST (optional)
- [ ] Create `.semgrep.yml` with basic ruleset
- [ ] Test security scanning with sample vulnerabilities

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (Week 5)

### 5.1 End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test full pipeline with `dev` branch push
- [ ] Test full pipeline with `main` branch push
- [ ] Verify manual approval gate functionality
- [ ] Test rollback procedures

### 5.2 Documentation
- [ ] Complete README.md with comprehensive instructions
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Document disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Document common troubleshooting steps

### 5.3 Security Validation
- [ ] Perform security assessment of the pipeline
- [ ] Verify secure credential handling
- [ ] Test TLS configuration
- [ ] Validate security headers

## Phase 6: Optimization and Enhancements (Week 6+)

### 6.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize Docker image sizes
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for builds
- [ ] Optimize deployment speed

### 6.2 Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Configure Traefik access logs (JSON)
- [ ] Set up Watchtower for image auto-pull
- [ ] Implement blue/green deployment via Traefik
- [ ] Add fail2ban for port 443

### 6.3 Training and Handover
- [ ] Create training materials for developers
- [ ] Document operational procedures
- [ ] Conduct knowledge transfer sessions
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## Maintenance Plan

### Regular Tasks
- Weekly review of security scans
- Monthly update of base images
- Quarterly review of access controls
- Bi-annual disaster recovery testing

### Continuous Improvement
- Collect metrics on pipeline performance
- Gather feedback from development team
- Stay updated on security best practices
- Evaluate new tools and technologies for integration
