# Property Edit Feature Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of property editing functionality with media management for the Hestami AI platform. This feature allows property owners to edit property details and manage media through both web and mobile interfaces.

## Implementation Date
October 12, 2025

## Architecture

### Backend (Django REST API)

#### 1. Property Descriptives Validation (`properties/serializers.py`)
- **Purpose**: Validate the `Property.descriptives` JSONField
- **Technology**: Django REST Framework serializers (no external dependencies)
- **Features**:
  - Flexible JSON structure for property attributes
  - Basic type validation for common fields (bedrooms, bathrooms, yearBuilt)
  - Allows any additional fields for future expansion
  - Simple validation with clear error messages

**Validated Fields**:
- `bathrooms`: Must be a positive number (allows decimals like 1.5, 2.5)
- `bedrooms`: Must be a positive integer
- `yearBuilt`: Must be between 1800 and 2100

**Flexible Fields** (no validation, stored as-is):
- Basic Info: propertyType, unitNumber, squareFootage
- HVAC: heatingSystem, airConditioning, coolingSystem
- Utilities: gas, sewer, water, electricity, internetCable
- Structure: garage, basement, gatedCommunity
- Any other custom fields

#### 2. PropertySerializer (`properties/serializers.py`)
- Added `validate_descriptives()` method
- Performs basic type checking on common fields
- Allows flexible schema for property-specific attributes
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

#### 3. Existing API Endpoints (No Changes Required)
```
PATCH /api/properties/<property_id>/update/     # Update property details
POST  /api/media/properties/<property_id>/upload/ # Upload media
GET   /api/media/properties/<property_id>/       # List media
DELETE /api/media/<media_id>/                    # Delete media
GET   /api/media/types/                          # Get media type options
GET   /api/media/locations/                      # Get location type options
```

### Frontend (SvelteKit)

#### File Structure
```
frontend/sveltekit/hestami-ai-ui/src/routes/properties/[id]/edit/
├── +page.server.ts              # Server-side data loading
├── +page.svelte                 # Main edit page with tabs
└── components/
    ├── PropertyForm.svelte      # Property details form
    ├── MediaUpload.svelte       # File upload with metadata
    └── MediaGallery.svelte      # Display and delete media
```

#### 1. Page Server Load (`+page.server.ts`)
**Responsibilities**:
- Load property data from API
- Load existing media for the property
- Load media type and location options for dropdowns
- Check user permissions (owner or explicit edit access)
- Handle authentication redirects

**Data Returned**:
- `property`: Full property object
- `media`: Array of media items
- `mediaTypes`: Available media type options
- `locationTypes`: Available location type options

#### 2. Main Edit Page (`+page.svelte`)
**Features**:
- Two-tab interface: "Property Details" and "Media"
- Success/error status messages with auto-dismiss
- Cancel button returns to property detail view
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS

**State Management**:
- Simple reactive statements, no complex state management
- Page refresh on media changes (invalidateAll)
- Event-driven communication between components

#### 3. PropertyForm Component
**Features**:
- Collapsible sections for better UX:
  - Basic Information (title, description, status)
  - Address (street, city, state, zip, county, country)
  - Property Details (type, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, year built)
  - Structure & Features (garage, basement, gated community)
  - HVAC & Climate Control (heating system, air conditioning)
  - Utilities (gas, electric, water, sewer, internet)
- HTML5 form validation
- Single "Save" button (no auto-save)
- Explicit error handling with user feedback

**Form Submission**:
- PATCH request to `/api/properties/<id>/update/`
- Sends only changed fields (partial update)
- Shows success message on save
- Emits events to parent component

#### 4. MediaUpload Component
**Features**:
- File input with visual upload area
- Multiple file selection support
- Per-file metadata forms:
  - Title (auto-populated from filename)
  - Description (optional)
  - Location Type (dropdown)
  - Location Sub-Type (dynamic based on location type)
- Individual file upload or "Upload All" button
- Upload progress indication
- Success/error feedback per file
- Automatic removal of successful uploads after 2 seconds

**Upload Flow**:
1. User selects files
2. Files added to upload queue with metadata forms
3. User fills in metadata for each file
4. User clicks "Upload This File" or "Upload All"
5. Files uploaded via FormData to API
6. Success/error feedback shown
7. Parent component refreshed on success

#### 5. MediaGallery Component
**Features**:
- Grid layout (responsive: 1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Filter by location type dropdown
- Media cards showing:
  - Thumbnail or type icon
  - Title and location
  - Description (truncated)
  - View and Delete actions
- Delete confirmation modal
- Processing status indicator for scanning files

**Delete Flow**:
1. User clicks "Delete" button
2. Confirmation modal appears
3. User confirms deletion
4. DELETE request to `/api/media/<media_id>/`
5. Parent component refreshed on success

## Design Decisions

### 1. Simple, Explicit User Actions
- **No auto-save**: User must click "Save" button
- **No real-time validation**: HTML5 validation on submit
- **No inline media editing**: Metadata set during upload only
- **No complex state management**: Simple reactive statements

**Rationale**: Keeps implementation simple, maintainable, and predictable. Reduces frontend complexity and potential bugs.

### 2. API-First Architecture
- All data operations through REST API
- Works for both web and mobile clients
- No server actions or form actions
- Client-side fetch() calls with credentials

**Rationale**: Ensures consistency across platforms and simplifies mobile app development.

### 3. Validated JSON Schema for Descriptives
- Pydantic schema with 80+ fields
- Allows extra fields for flexibility
- Validates on backend, not frontend

**Rationale**: Provides structure without requiring database migrations. Easy to extend with new fields.

### 4. Collapsible Form Sections
- Reduces visual clutter
- Improves form navigation
- Basic sections expanded by default

**Rationale**: Makes long forms more manageable without complex multi-step wizards.

### 5. Page Refresh on Media Changes
- Simple `goto()` with `invalidateAll: true`
- No manual state synchronization

**Rationale**: Ensures UI always shows current data. Simpler than manual state updates.

## Usage

### For Property Owners

1. **Navigate to Property Edit Page**:
   - Go to property details page
   - Click "Edit Property" button (to be added to detail page)
   - Or navigate directly to `/properties/{id}/edit`

2. **Edit Property Details**:
   - Click on section headers to expand/collapse
   - Fill in or update fields
   - Click "Save Property Details" button
   - Success message appears on save

3. **Upload Media**:
   - Switch to "Media" tab
   - Click "Click to upload" or drag files
   - Fill in metadata for each file
   - Click "Upload This File" or "Upload All"
   - Files appear in gallery after upload

4. **Manage Media**:
   - View uploaded media in gallery
   - Filter by location type
   - Click "View" to open full-size
   - Click "Delete" to remove (with confirmation)

### For Developers

#### Adding New Descriptive Fields

1. **Update Schema** (`properties/schemas.py`):
```python
class PropertyDescriptivesSchema(BaseModel):
    # Add new field
    new_field: Optional[str] = Field(None, alias="newField")
```

2. **Update Frontend Form** (`PropertyForm.svelte`):
```svelte
<div>
  <label for="newField">New Field</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    id="newField"
    bind:value={descriptives.newField}
  />
</div>
```

#### Testing the Feature

1. **Start Development Server**:
```bash
cd frontend/sveltekit/hestami-ai-ui
npm run dev
```

2. **Navigate to Edit Page**:
```
http://localhost:3000/properties/{property-id}/edit
```

3. **Test Property Update**:
   - Edit fields in form
   - Click "Save Property Details"
   - Check browser network tab for PATCH request
   - Verify success message appears

4. **Test Media Upload**:
   - Switch to Media tab
   - Select files
   - Fill in metadata
   - Click upload
   - Verify files appear in gallery

5. **Test Media Delete**:
   - Click delete on a media item
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify item removed from gallery

## API Request Examples

### Update Property
```http
PATCH /api/properties/{property_id}/update/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Updated Property Title",
  "descriptives": {
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2.5,
    "squareFootage": 2000,
    "heatingSystem": "forced_air",
    "garage": true
  }
}
```

### Upload Media
```http
POST /api/media/properties/{property_id}/upload/
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: [binary file data]
title: "Kitchen Photo"
description: "Renovated kitchen"
location_type: "INTERIOR"
location_sub_type: "KITCHEN"
media_type: "IMAGE"
```

### Delete Media
```http
DELETE /api/media/{media_id}/
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Permission Checks**: Backend validates user has edit permission
2. **File Scanning**: All uploaded files scanned for malware via ClamAV
3. **Authentication**: All requests require valid JWT token
4. **CSRF Protection**: Credentials included in fetch requests
5. **Input Validation**: Schema validation on backend prevents invalid data

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Media thumbnails loaded with `loading="lazy"`
2. **Optimized Images**: Backend generates thumbnails for faster loading
3. **Partial Updates**: Only changed fields sent in PATCH requests
4. **Efficient Queries**: Backend uses select_related/prefetch_related
5. **Client-Side Filtering**: Location filter works on already-loaded data

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Drag-and-Drop File Upload**: Add drop zone for easier file selection
2. **Bulk Media Operations**: Select multiple items for batch delete
3. **Media Reordering**: Drag-and-drop to change display order
4. **Image Cropping**: Allow users to crop images before upload
5. **Auto-Save Draft**: Save form state to localStorage
6. **Field History**: Track changes to property fields over time
7. **Media Tagging**: Add custom tags to media items
8. **Advanced Search**: Search media by title, description, or tags

### Not Implemented (By Design)
1. **Inline Media Metadata Editing**: Metadata set during upload only
2. **Real-Time Validation**: HTML5 validation sufficient
3. **Auto-Save**: Explicit save button preferred
4. **Complex State Management**: Simple approach works well

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Form doesn't save
- **Check**: Browser console for errors
- **Check**: Network tab for failed requests
- **Check**: User has edit permission
- **Solution**: Verify API endpoint is accessible

**Issue**: Media upload fails
- **Check**: File size within limits
- **Check**: File type is supported
- **Check**: ClamAV is running
- **Solution**: Check backend logs for scan errors

**Issue**: Images don't display
- **Check**: File was scanned successfully
- **Check**: Thumbnail generation completed
- **Check**: Static media server is running
- **Solution**: Verify file_url and thumbnail_url are valid

**Issue**: Descriptives validation errors
- **Check**: Field types match schema
- **Check**: Required fields are provided
- **Check**: Values within allowed ranges
- **Solution**: Review schema definition for constraints
