- **Production Domain Setup**: Configure production domain settings. *(Satisfies RTM ID: DOM-001)*
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing.

# Milestones
1. **Milestone 1**: Completion of infrastructure setup and environment configuration.
2. **Milestone 2**: Completion of each thin vertical slice, delivering functional increments.
3. **Milestone 3**: Successful integration testing and verification.
4. **Milestone 4**: Deployment to staging environment and final testing.

# Notes
- Regularly update the RTM with implementation status and test case results.
- Adjust the sequence of slices as necessary based on development progress and feedback.
- Ensure continuous integration and deployment pipelines are in place for efficient testing and deployment.
