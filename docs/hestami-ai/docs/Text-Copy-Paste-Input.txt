The best service and advisement a worried homeowner could ask for.

Steve from Roofer911 came out to inspect two leaks on around our townhouse's bump out. The Steve was professional, timely, had excellent communication on when he would arrive, and expertly identified multiple points where water was likely getting in from.

Steve advised on next steps and recommended fixes. All of this within 30 minutes.

I would recommend Roofer 911 for anyone needing a roof /window leak specialist. We are so grateful for Steve's recommendations and walk through on some of the DIY fixes.

Thank you Steve and Roofer911!

You have to call multiple times and email over and over for responses. Not sure they're legitimate because googling people who work there and found some to be realtors and such.

I called four companies. I chose 911 because Steve provided the BEST customer service. He explained the process. He gave me options and did not try to convince me. He let it be my option of what I wanted.

Day of install they showed up on time. They placed tarp over everything all around the house. They cleaned up any mess on the ground, in the trees, on my 2nd level deck and at my neighbors.

They wouldn't start working on the roof until my next door neighbor moved his car. They ring doorbell and knocked until they answered. They were also ready to have a worker stand up with a board to prevent any shingles dropping into their car if they did not answer.

We walked the property, they showed me the damage boards and painted my stuff with a protective coating.

I could not say how much I appreciate Steve and his crew.

It has not rained yet, but I trust the install and truly believe everything will be just fine. I had the architectural GAF pewter grey installed in case you want to know the color.

We requested a estimate on a roof repair. The technician seemed knowledgeable and sent pictures with a digital proposal. We decided to go with the proposal, but could not access the proposal. After leaving numerous messages, without a response, we have decided to move on to a reputable roofer.

Steve's crew did an amazing job! We purchased a house with an actively leaking roof and knew it had to be replaced ASAP. We got a ton of quotes and scheduled the job on our moving day.

They replaced our entire roof (2000+ sq ft ranch) in one day - had 10 guys and a foreman cranking. Arrived at 7am, we ordered them pizza for lunch as a thank you, and they were cleaned up and done by 3pm. It looks fantastic!

We got several quotes from competitors, all ranging from $13-16K. Steve's fell in the middle and we chose him because his inspection was so thorough (I couldn't make it in-person so he sent me a video from my roof of his evaluation and called out all of our problem areas). His Yelp reviews are great, he's quick and responsive, quote and warranty are fair/reasonable, and his crew did a fantastic job.

We did have one issue that I am very happy was resolved. The crew's tarp slipped during one application and they got tar on my gutter. The guys tried to scrape it off but it had hardened - they said they could paint over it but it wouldn't look perfect (I was not happy). Steve showed up to review the work that afternoon and when I pointed it out, he agreed he wouldn't want to look at the tar either and assured me he would replace the gutter. It has now been replaced and looks fantastic - brand new gutter, great resolution. I appreciate the follow through and dedication to detail.

I'll post pics of the before and after roof when it's not covered in snow! Thank you, Roofer 911!

Steve's crew at work - 10+ guys, they finished in one day!

Wow Elizabeth, I thank you so much for your very kind review!

When I first inspected your roof and noticed all its problems, I knew I had to make you a very thorough video so you could see exactly what I was looking at and explain why your roof needed to be removed and replaced..

Not only does your new roof look absolutely beautiful it is now 100% watertight!

I greatly appreciate your business!

Thank you,
Steve

I had a great experience with Roofer 911. I needed a total roof replacement on my 1950s house - including all of the wood underneath the shingles. Of the three estimates I received, Roofer 911 was the second lowest, but beat out the competition with their warranty and experience. They were also willing to give me a "worst case scenario" number so I could adjust my saving accordingly. A key tip for any major work, I've found, is to make sure you can afford any scenario before embarking on a project!

All of my communication was directly with Steve, the owner, and he called me several times during the course of the work and afterward to send pictures and consult about issues as they came up. I was home during the day and the crew was prompt and hardworking, they even took delivery of my Amazon packages when the delivery guy didn't want to venture up to the house through the work.

Overall I am very pleased; I feel like I got great workmanship and a fair value on a big expense! Steve never tried to upsell or nickel-and-dime me, he waived an extra service charge when it was discovered that I had an extra layer of shingles to be removed and my invoice was clear with no surprises. A new roof is never going to be cheap, but I really appreciate the quality of Roofer 911's work and their straightforward, honest approach to the process.

The difference a roof makes!

Hi Amy,

Thank you so much for your very kind review! Not only does your new roof look absolutely beautiful, it's now 100% water-tight.

Even though we had to remove one additional layer of roof shingles, I couldn't charge you additional because I should've noticed that when I first inspected your roof.

It was my sincere pleasure to be of service and I greatly appreciate your business!!

Thank you,
Steven

Communication was great. Timely and professional. Unfortunately didn't get to go beyond the initial stages. We have high risk contacts in terms of folks who can get sick with COVID. So at the minimum we ask for masks from guests to come in the house if these folks are around.

At another point in time, this wouldn't be an issue. And for many others, it may not be an issue at all. It is what it is during these crazy times, but I would not hesitate to recommend contacting this service for the responsiveness and professionalism.

I had a 20-year roof that needed replacing. I had a bunch of companies provide me with estimates but I was impressed with Steve the most. Not only did his company have great reviews, but I could also tell that Steve knew what he was talking about, and from that, I knew I would receive excellent service.

Steve's crew did an excellent job, they were able to work on my roof immediately, and were able to finish in one day. I am very satisfied with their work. I highly recommend them.

I highly recommend Steve!

I needed a new roof so I Googled and found Roofer911. Over the phone, Steve sounded very professional and knowledgeable.

My roof was installed on the day promised and the roofers were done within 5 hours and looks great.

Throughout the process, Steve kept me up to day. What I appreciated the most was that every time I called Steve, he picked up - never let his phone go to voicemail. That in itself gave me assurance early on that I am dealing with a responsible and professional contractor.

G&G cleaned out my gutters in a tall house for a reasonable price. The gutters were cleaned out well and I will hire them again.

My one comment would be to clearly communicate that you have a tall roof that may need harnesses. G&G can bring harnesses if you have a three story house. Just let G&G know.

Thumbs up to G&G and I will see them in a few months.…Read more
