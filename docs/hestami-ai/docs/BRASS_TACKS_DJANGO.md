Hestami AI Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of the Hestami AI platform using Agile methodology, specifically following the "Thin Vertical Slice" approach. The goal is to deliver incremental, end-to-end functionality that provides immediate value to users. Each phase represents a vertical slice of the system, encompassing all layers from the frontend to the backend, and is focused on a specific set of features.

This document outlines the system requirements for creating a secure REST API with Django 5.1 with Django REST Framework (DRF) for the backend with Python 3.12 as the base requirement. The application will use PostgreSQL 17 or later as the database and will be containerized with Docker and docker-compose. The application must support both production and development environments running on the same host machine using the following approach.

NOTA BENE: We are strictly focused on proof of concept and proof of value. Specifically we are just implementing Phases 1 and 2 which are the user registration and authentication and media upload and management phases.


IN SCOPE FOR MVP
Phase 1: User Registration and Authentication
Phase 2: Homeowner Media Upload and Management
Phase 3: Bid Request Creation and Viewing
Phase 4: Service Provider Registration and Bid Submission
Phase 5: Bid Evaluation and AI Agent Logging
Phase 6: Communication Logging and Notifications
Phase 7: Ratings and Reviews System
Phase 8: Availability Management for Service Providers
Phase 9: Mobile Optimization and Media Upload Enhancements
Phase 10: Social Login and Third-Party Integrations
Phase 11: Security Enhancements and Audit Trails
Phase 12: Deployment and Scalability Preparations

Hestami AI System Requirements

### Backend Specifications:

- **Framework:** Django 5.1 with Django REST Framework (DRF).
- **Authentication:**
    - Use SimpleJWT for token-based authentication.
    - Provide endpoints for login, signup, token refresh, and user roles.
    - Return tokens via Set-Cookie headers for secure storage.
    
    Password Policies:
        - Minimum length: 12 characters
        - Must contain at least:
            - One uppercase letter
            - One lowercase letter
            - One number
            - One special character
        - Cannot contain common patterns or dictionary words
        - Cannot be similar to user's personal information
        - Password change required every 90 days for staff users
        - Cannot reuse last 5 passwords
        - Account lockout after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes
    
    Session Management:
        - Access token validity: 15 minutes
        - Refresh token validity: 7 days
        - Maximum 3 concurrent sessions per user
        - Force logout on password change
        - "Remember me" extends refresh token to 30 days
        - Session invalidation on:
            - Password change
            - Role change
            - Account suspension
            - Security breach detection

Relationships Between Entities

    User has one PropertyOwnerProfile or one ServiceProviderProfile, depending on user_type.
    PropertyOwnerProfile can have multiple PropertyOwnerships.
    Property can have multiple PropertyOwnerships.
    PropertyOwnership links a PropertyOwnerProfile to a Property with ownership dates.
    PropertyOwnerProfile can create multiple BidRequests associated with properties they own.
    BidRequest can have multiple Media items attached.
    Media is associated with a Property and the PropertyOwnerProfile at the time of upload.
    BidRequest can receive multiple Bids from different ServiceProviderProfiles.
    PropertyOwnerProfile can rate ServiceProviderProfiles via Rating after a bid is completed.
    ServiceProviderProfile has one Availability.
    AIActivityLog records actions related to BidRequests and Bids.
    CommunicationLog tracks communications between users and AI agents.

Since I'm unable to provide visual diagrams, I'll describe the relationships in text format.

    User (1) — (1) PropertyOwnerProfile (optional)
    User (1) — (1) ServiceProviderProfile (optional)
    PropertyOwnerProfile (1) — (M) PropertyOwnership
    Property (1) — (M) PropertyOwnership
    PropertyOwnership links PropertyOwnerProfile to Property
    PropertyOwnerProfile (1) — (M) BidRequest
    Property (1) — (M) BidRequest
    BidRequest (M) — (M) Media
    Media (M) — (1) Property

================================================

Prefer Function Based Views (with decorators: @api_view, @authentication_classes, @permission_classes, @renderer_classes, @parser_classes) over Class Based Views when and where possible.

NOTA BENE: Class Based Views for the Django admin interface is probably recommended.


List of API Endpoints to be Implemented

Based on the project's requirements, functionalities, and the updated structure focusing on Function-Based Views (FBVs) with appropriate decorators, here is a comprehensive list of API endpoints that need to be implemented.
