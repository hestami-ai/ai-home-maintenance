## Implementation Notes

### Security Features
- Password complexity enforced with minimum length, special characters, and case requirements
- Argon2 password hashing implemented for enhanced security
- Session management configured with token rotation and secure cookie handling
- CORS and security headers properly configured for production

### Infrastructure
- Docker Compose networks properly segmented for production
- Static file serving configured with Nginx
- Redis caching implemented for session management
- Logging and monitoring setup complete

### API and Integration
- All API endpoints implemented with proper authentication
- Role-based access control enforced at middleware level
- Integration tests covering all major functionality
- Error handling and validation implemented

## Verification Status
All requirements have been implemented and verified through:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for authentication flow
- End-to-end tests for user journeys
- Security testing for authentication and authorization

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Conduct load testing
3. Perform security audit
4. Monitor system performance
